Hello!

The Assembler Project was created in a class I took Sophomore year called Foundations of Computing where we learned different gates (NOT, AND, OR, etc) and also assembly

The Red-Black Tree Project was developed by me in a class called Advanced Data Structures. This class focus on building these data structures dynamically, and maintaining memory-safe code throughout with the use of valgrind.
